<h1>Page breaks</h1>

You should specify when page breaks must occur and when they should not occur. Modern browsers implement three CSS constructs: page-break-before, page-break-after, page-break-inside, orphans and widows. 
page-break-before and page-break-after take the following values: auto, always, avoid, left, right and inherit
page-break-inside can be avoid, auto or inherit
orphans and widows, is a number (e.g. 2)

Note that these are recommendations, i.e. a browser generating the print document should but does not need to use these heuristics: 
 Break as few times as possible.
 Make all pages that do not end with a forced break appear to have about the same height.
 Avoid breaking inside a replaced element. 

Below are some typical use cases. 
page-break-before defines if page breaks should occur before the tag, typically titlesExample
 section {page-break-before: always;}
 h1 {page-break-before: always;}

page-break-after defines if page breaks should occur after a tag
 section {page-break-after: always;}
 h1 {page-break-after: avoid;}

page-break-inside defines if page breaks should occur inside an element.
 p {page-break-inside: avoid;}

orphans and widows - CSS 2.1 also allows to specify what happens with orphans and widows. 
“The 'orphans' property specifies the minimum number of lines in a block container 
that must be left at the bottom of a page. The 'widows' property specifies the 
minimum number of lines in a block container that must be left at the top of a page. 
Examples of how they are used to control page breaks are given below.”
 p {orphans:3; widows:2;}
